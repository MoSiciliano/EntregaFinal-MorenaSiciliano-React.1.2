# Hi ThereðŸ‘‹

## My name is Morena Siciliano and I am going to show you the progress of my project for the React Js course, at [Coderhouse](https://www.coderhouse.com/) for the Full Stack Developer career

In the process of developing this web application I learned and acquired a lot of knowledge about React Js, as well as I continued implementing CSS and internalizing the styles.Of course you can also find our dear colleague JavaScript too.

1. Git
2. Components, States, Props, Patterns, Effects,etc.
3. Sugar Syntax
4. Jsx
5. Promises
6. Routing and navigation
7. CSS styles
8. APi's
